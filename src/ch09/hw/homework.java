//Use the SortedABPriQ class to help solve the following problem. 
//Create an application Random10K that generates 100 numbers between 1 and 10,000, 
//stores them in a priority queue (you can wrap them in an Integer object), and then 
//prints them out in columns 10 integers wide in
//1) decreasing order
//2) increasing order
//3) ordered increasingly by the sum of the digits in the number.
