//TreeFullness Application problem
//
//32. Design and implement a method height for Binary-
//SearchTree, that returns the height of the tree with recursion or iteratively.
//
//47.Revise our BSTInterface interface and Binary-
//SearchTree class to include the balance method. 
//
//48.Fullness Experiment:
//1.	Design and implement a method height for Binary-
//	SearchTree that returns the height of the tree 
//2.	Define the fullness ratio of a binary tree to be the ratio between
//	its minimum height and its height (given the number
//	of nodes in the tree). For example, the tree in Figure 7.5a has
//	a fullness ratio of 1.00 (its minimum height is 3 and its height
//	is 3) and the tree in Figure 7.6c has a fullness ratio of 0.33 (its
//	minimum height is 3 and its height is 9). Implement a
//	method fRatio to be added to the BinarySearchTree class
//	that returns the fullness ratio of the tree.
//3.    Create an application that generates 10 “random” trees, each
//	with 1,000 nodes (random integers between 1 and 3,000). For
//	each tree output its height, optimal height, and fullness ratio.
//4. Submit a report that includes your code for the height
//method, the fRatio method, the application code, sample
//output, and a short discussion. The discussion should include
//consideration of how the fRatio method might be used by an
//application to keep its search trees reasonably well balanced.


// FileAnalzyer Application problem
//
//52. Create an application that will read a text file (file name/location
//provided through a command line argument) and display the
//longest word (or words if there is a tie) in the file and how many
//times they occur.
//
//53.Create an application that will read a text file (file name/location
//	provided through a command line argument) and display the
//	most frequently used word (or words if there is a tie) in the file and
//	how many times they occur.
//
//54.Create an application that will read a text file (file name/location
//	provided through a command line argument) and display the
//	word or words in the file that occur exactly once.
