//***************************************
//Problem #12  done
//***************************************
//Create an application, similar to StringPairApp, which
//acts as a chemistry quiz. It randomly generates a periodic number
//between 1 and 118 and asks the user for the corresponding element.
//It then checks their answer against the correct answer (using a map
//based on the periodic.txt file) and reports the result, displaying
//the correct answer if they get it wrong. It repeats this for 10 questions
//and then reports the percentage of correct answers. How can
//your application be made more generally usable?


//***************************************
//Problem #13 done
//***************************************
//Java reserved words can be categorized into subsets such as
//“primitive types,” “control,” “access control,” etc. Research the reserved
//words and create your own categorization scheme. Then...
//
//1) Create an application called Categories that first creates a
//map based on your categorization of reserved words (e.g., int
// “primitive type”) and then reads a .java file and displays
//the keyword types found in the file. For example, if MapEntry.
//java is the input file then the output, depending on your
//categorization, might look like this:
//
//control, organization, access control, definition,
//control . . . because of the sequence of reserved
//words for (see opening comment), package, public,
//class, protected, . . .
//
//2) Improve your application so that it ignores the contents of literal
//strings.
//
//3) Improve your application so that it ignores the contents of
//comments.


//***************************************
//Problem #29
//***************************************
//Create an application that uses HMap and reads a list of
//words from a provided file and outputs whether or not any word repeats.
//As soon as the application determines there is at least one repeated
//word it can display “<such and such word> repeats” and terminate.
//If no words repeat it displays “No words repeat” and terminates.
